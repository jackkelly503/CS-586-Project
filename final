Summary
My database contains time series data downloaded from the BLS website and includes data on employment, food prices, and inflation. Data can be downloaded directly from the BLS website by entering the series id. Once downloaded, minor data cleaning was required before I was able to upload it to PostgreSQL using the GUI. 
Data References
All data is hosted at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/data/) and is derived from the following three surveys.
From the BLS website:
 “The Current Population Survey (CPS) provides a wealth of information on the nation’s labor force including data on the employed, unemployed, and those not in the labor force. Key CPS measures are the unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, and employment-population ratio.”
“The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program produces detailed industry estimates of nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings of workers on payrolls. CES National Estimates produces data for the nation, and CES State and Metro Area produces estimates for all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and about 450 metropolitan areas and divisions.”
“The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Indexes are available for the U.S. and various geographic areas. Average price data for select utility, automotive fuel, and food items are also available.”
The following bullets list the source for each attribute in my database that is sourced from the BLS.

Data Cleaning and Populating the Database

The BLS provides the ability to download data in various formats.
1.	https://data.bls.gov/series-report. This page allows you download the desired data using the series-id(s). The screen shot below is for the unemployment rate.
 
2.	When you select next you are taken to the following page. There are several options to select from including the data format and time frame. Select Retrieve Data.

 

3.	Select download to get an Excel file of the data. 
 
4.	Example of what the data looks like with no modifications.  
Replace the series id with the attribute name, convert the date formats, and transpose the data. 
 
5.	The final step is to save as a csv and load to the database using the GUI.
To verify and check data integrity I made sure that the number of rows imported matched the csv file and that there were no nulls. I also spot checked several data points in each table and visually compared to the BLS values.

20 Questions 
I modified and replaced many of my original questions. The primary reasons were to increase the difficulty of the query and to incorporate the profession relationship that I added after Part 1. 
1.	I changed this question to make it more challenging and because I do not have weeks unemployed in my data as originally planned.

Original: What is the date(s) where the difference between the average weeks unemployed and median weeks unemployed was at a minimum and maximum.

Updated: Which profession and region had the maximum and minimum weekly earnings for December 2024?

SQL
SELECT 
    e.date, 
    p.profession,
    r.region,
    e.ave_weekly_earnings
FROM earnings e, prof_rel p, region_rel r
WHERE e.profession_id = p.profession_id
AND e.region_id = r.region_id
AND e.date = '2024-12-31'
AND ave_weekly_earnings = (
    SELECT MAX(ave_weekly_earnings) 
    FROM earnings
    WHERE date = '2024-12-31'
)
UNION
SELECT 
    e.date, 
    p.profession,
    r.region,
    e.ave_weekly_earnings
FROM earnings e, prof_rel p, region_rel r
WHERE e.profession_id = p.profession_id
AND e.region_id = r.region_id
AND e.date = '2024-12-31'
AND ave_weekly_earnings = (
    SELECT MIN(ave_weekly_earnings) 
    FROM earnings
    WHERE date = '2024-12-31'
);

Screenshot
 


2.	Compare the unemployment levels between California and Nevada for the past six months.
SQL
SELECT 
    date, 
    region_rel.region AS region, 
    unemployment_rate 
FROM employment
JOIN region_rel ON employment.region_id = region_rel.region_id
WHERE region_rel.region IN ('California', 'Nevada') 
    AND date > '2024-06-30'
ORDER BY 
    date, region;
Screenshot
 
3.	I updated this question to make it more challenging.

Original: Calculate the average sum of the employed population for each region over the past six months.

Updated: Which regions had an increase in the average employment level for 2024 compared to 2023?

SQL
SELECT 
    r.region,
    TO_CHAR(
        AVG(CASE WHEN e.date >= '2024-01-31' THEN e.employment_level END) -
        AVG(CASE WHEN e.date >= '2023-01-31' AND e.date <= '2023-12-31' THEN e.employment_level END), 
        'FM999,999,999') AS change
FROM employment e JOIN region_rel r ON e.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region
HAVING 
    AVG(CASE WHEN e.date >= '2024-01-31' THEN e.employment_level END) >
    AVG(CASE WHEN e.date >= '2023-01-31' AND e.date <= '2023-12-31' THEN e.employment_level END);

Screenshot
 

4.	I updated the question to make it more challenging by adding two subqueries and the National filter.

Original: Identify the top 3 dates with the highest labor force participation rate in each region.

Updated: When was the national labor force participation rate at its highest, and what was the unemployment rate during this time?

SQL
SELECT 
    e.date, 
    e.labor_force_participation_rate,
    e.unemployment_rate
FROM employment e
WHERE e.region_id = (SELECT region_id FROM region_rel WHERE region= 'National')
    AND e.labor_force_participation_rate =
     (SELECT MAX(e.labor_force_participation_rate)
       FROM employment e
       JOIN region_rel r ON e.region_id = r.region_id 
       WHERE r.region = 'National'
       GROUP BY e.region_id);


Screenshot
 

5.	I changed this question because I have enough max and min questions. Also, I added profession after I wrote the original, and I want to utilize this relationship.

Original: Determine the difference in the average labor force participation rate between the highest and lowest performing regions over the past year.

Updated: What was the pandemic impact to average weekly earnings by region and profession?

SQL
SELECT 
    r.region AS region,
    p.profession AS profession,
    TO_CHAR(
    AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ea.date) = 2020 THEN ea.ave_weekly_earnings END) -
    AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ea.date) = 2019 THEN ea.ave_weekly_earnings END)
, 'FM999,999,999') AS change_in_weekly_earnings
FROM earnings ea
JOIN region_rel r ON ea.region_id = r.region_id
JOIN prof_rel p ON ea.profession_id = p.profession_id
JOIN employment emp ON ea.date = emp.date AND ea.region_id = emp.region_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ea.date) IN (2019, 2020)
GROUP BY r.region, p.profession
ORDER BY region, profession;

Screenshot
 

6.	This is replacing question 17 which asks about weeks unemployed (not in db). It is also a continuation of five. 

Original: Compare the average weeks unemployed in Dec 2020 to Dec 2024 for all states and the national.

Updated: What was the impact on the average employment level for each region during the pandemic?

SQL
SELECT 
    r.region AS region,
   TO_CHAR(
     AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM emp.date) = 2020 THEN emp.employment_level END) -
     AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM emp.date) = 2019 THEN emp.employment_level END),
    'FM999,999,999') AS change_in_employment_level
FROM earnings ea
JOIN region_rel r ON ea.region_id = r.region_id
JOIN employment emp ON ea.date = emp.date AND ea.region_id = emp.region_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ea.date) IN (2019, 2020)
GROUP BY r.region
ORDER BY region;

Screenshot
 

7.	I made a minor change to this question and instead I am bringing in the year end inflation for all three measures. The inflation rate is the 12-month change, so the year end is the same and the annual. 

Original: What is the average annual medical inflation for the last 5 years?

Updated: What is the year end/annual inflation for all three measures for all years?

SQL
SELECT 
    date, 
    cpi, 
    cpi_less_food_energy, 
    cpi_medical
FROM inflation
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 12
AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM date) = 31
ORDER BY date DESC;

Screenshot:
 

8.	This question does not make a lot of sense, and I don’t really like it. I am changing it to query food prices and making it a bit more challenging. 

Original: From 2019-2024, what was the mean and median inflation less food and energy?

Updated: What is the National average price of a dozen eggs for 2019 through 2024?

SQL
SELECT
TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2019 THEN f.eggs_dz END),
'FM999,999,999.99') AS egg_price_2019,
TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2020 THEN f.eggs_dz END),
'FM999,999,999.99') AS egg_price_2020,
TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2021 THEN f.eggs_dz END),

TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2022 THEN f.eggs_dz END),

TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2023 THEN f.eggs_dz END),

TO_CHAR(AVG(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.date) = 2024 THEN f.eggs_dz END),

WHERE r.region_id = f.region_id
AND r.region = 'National';

9.	The data to answer this question is not in the db. 

Original: What is the Oregon and Washington unemployment rate when California’s inflation rate was at a minimum?

Updated: What is the unemployment rate, price per pound of bacon, and the cpi for year-end over the last five years?

SQL
